# Cahyo Lampu üí°‚öôÔ∏è

**Cahyo Lampu** is a simple automatic lamp project that turns on or dims based on the surrounding light intensity. This project uses a light sensor (LDR) and an LED, and is illustrated with a miniature cardboard house.

## Features
- Turns on in the dark and dims in bright light automatically
- Uses an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor
- Visual representation with a cardboard house
- Includes code explanation and logic simulation

## Basic Components
- LDR (analog light sensor)
- LED
- Resistors
- [Arduino UNO/NANO/MEGA](https://www.arduino.cc/) (or similar microcontroller)
- Jumper wires
- Liquid Crystal I2C (Optional)
- Cardboard (for the miniature house)

## Code Installation Setup

### Prerequisites
- The physical prototype of the project
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) installed in latest version
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed (if you want to clone/fork this project and contribute)

### Libraries Required
- Wire (pre-installed with Arduino IDE)
- LiquidCrystal_I2C (can be installed via Arduino Library Manager, optional)

To install the `LiquidCrystal_I2C` library:
1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Go to `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Manage Libraries...`
3. Search for `LiquidCrystal_I2C` and install the latest version.


## Project Demo
If you are just curious and want to see the online demo, you can see it in this [Wokwi Projects](https://wokwi.com/projects/415244886912403457). Happy experimenting! ‚ú®

## How It Works
The LDR sensor reads the light intensity and adjusts the LED output:
- When it's dark (high LDR value), the LED lights up brightly
- When it's bright (low LDR value), the LED dims or turns off

## Sample Code
```cpp
int ldrPin = A0;
int ledPin = 9;

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int ldrValue = analogRead(ldrPin);
  int brightness = map(ldrValue, 0, 1023, 255, 0); 
  analogWrite(ledPin, brightness);
  delay(200);
}
```
